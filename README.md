# progressiveBudget
this app allows the user to enter an expense title and ammount and then indicate by button click if this is being added to the budget or subtracted from the budget. This data is stored in a database as well as being passed to a chart that keeps track of each debit or credit. We were then tasked with making this application a PWA, or progressive web app. In doing so it allows for the application to be downloaded, as well as continue it's functionality while offline. It locally stores transactions while offline using indexedDB and passes those transactions back to the applications database once returning to online status, working with the service worker to do so.
